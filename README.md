# IMBALANCED-HEALTHCARE-DATA-HANDLING
Recently, scientists have been using computers to store and analyze health data. This data is not always balanced, which can make it difficult to use. 
Using the imblearn library from python weâ€™ll try over-sampling and under-sampling to balance the class in the healthcare dataset.
And try to develop a better model which will give us a better accuracy than traditional models without considering the relative distribution of each class in the dataset.
